In today's digital landscape, Identity and Access Management (IAM) plays a vital role in protecting sensitive data, ensuring regulatory compliance, and enhancing global security. As organisations adopt remote work, cloud technologies, and collaborative tools, IAM is crucial for supporting these initiatives whilst maintaining security.

IAM ensures that the right individuals have appropriate access to technology and resources, simplifying user access management and preventing unauthorised access. This is particularly important for industries with stringent identity and access control regulations, such as finance, healthcare, and government.

The importance of IAM cannot be overstated. Security starts with your identity solution, making IAM foundational for adopting new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Moreover, with the increasing focus on cybersecurity, professionals skilled in IAM are in high demand.

Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a leading IAM platform that provides a solid foundation for managing identities and access. Although this article focuses on Microsoft Entra ID, the principles learned can be applied to other platforms as well.
